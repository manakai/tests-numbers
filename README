Different tests in this repository are written in different formats.

Many tests adopt the HTCT test case description format, which is a
generaliztion of the HTML parser's tree construction stage test
suite's format, applicable to other protocols as well.  See
<https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/HTCT> for more information.
